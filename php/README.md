# [Jawg Maps](https://www.jawg.io/lab/)

### Get key to access JawgLab (if you have an API key skip this)
#### Step 1: Signup/Login
* Create an account to access [JawgLab](https://www.jawg.io/lab/)
* go to signup/login link https://www.jawg.io/lab/
* you will need to agree to MapQuest's Terms of Service https://www.jawg.io/en/terms/

#### Step 2: Getting api token
* Once logged in you should see you token at https://www.jawg.io/lab/


With this in place, make a GET request: https://api.jawg.io/routing/route/v1/car/#{SOURCE[:longitude]},#{SOURCE[:latitude]};#{DESTINATION[:longitude]},#{DESTINATION[:latitude]}?overview=full&access-token=#{KEY}

### Note:
* we will be sending `overview` as `full`.
* Setting overview as full sends us complete route. Default value for `overview` is `simplified`, which is an approximate (smoothed) path of the resulting directions.
* Jawg accepts source and destination, as semicolon seperated
  `{:longitude,:latitude}`


```php

//using jawmaps API

//Source and Destination Coordinates..
// Dallas, TX - coordinates
$source_longitude='-96.79448';
$source_latitude='32.78165';
//Addison, TX - coordinates
$destination_longitude='-96.818';
$destination_latitude='32.95399';
$key = 'jawmaps_api_key';

$url = 'https://api.jawg.io/routing/route/v1/car/'.$source_longitude.','.$source_latitude.';'.$destination_longitude.','.$destination_latitude.'?overview=full&access-token='.$key.'';

//connection..
$jawmaps = curl_init();

curl_setopt($jawmaps, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, false);
curl_setopt($jawmaps, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);

curl_setopt($jawmaps, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt($jawmaps, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

//getting response from jawmapsapi..
$response = curl_exec($jawmaps);
$err = curl_error($jawmaps);

curl_close($jawmaps);

if ($err) {
	  echo "cURL Error #:" . $err;
} else {
	  echo "200 : OK\n";
}

//extracting polyline from the JSON response..
$data_jawmaps = json_decode($response, true);

//polyline..
$polyline_jawmaps = $data_jawmaps['routes']['0']['geometry'];


```

Note:

We extracted the polyline for a route from Jawgmaps

We need to send this route polyline to TollGuru API to receive toll information

## [TollGuru API](https://tollguru.com/developers/docs/)

### Get key to access TollGuru polyline API
* create a dev account to receive a free key from TollGuru https://tollguru.com/developers/get-api-key
* suggest adding `vehicleType` parameter. Tolls for cars are different than trucks and therefore if `vehicleType` is not specified, may not receive accurate tolls. For example, tolls are generally higher for trucks than cars. If `vehicleType` is not specified, by default tolls are returned for 2-axle cars. 
* Similarly, `departure_time` is important for locations where tolls change based on time-of-the-day and can be passed through `$postdata`.

the last line can be changed to following

```php

//using tollguru API..
$curl = curl_init();

curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, false);
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);


$postdata = array(
	"source" => "gmaps",
	"polyline" => $polyline_jawmaps
);

//json encoding source and polyline to send as postfields..
$encode_postData = json_encode($postdata);

curl_setopt_array($curl, array(
CURLOPT_URL => "https://dev.tollguru.com/v1/calc/route",
CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
CURLOPT_ENCODING => "",
CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS => 10,
CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 30,
CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION => CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1,
CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST => "POST",


//sending jawmaps polyline to tollguru
CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => $encode_postData,
CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => array(
				      "content-type: application/json",
				      "x-api-key: tollguru_api_key"),
));

$response = curl_exec($curl);
$err = curl_error($curl);

curl_close($curl);

if ($err) {
	  echo "cURL Error #:" . $err;
} else {
	  echo "200 : OK\n";
}

//response from tollguru..
var_dump(json_decode($response, true));
// $data = var_dump(json_decode($response, true));
//print_r($data);

```
